## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the github of the Research Group NÃºcleo MÃºsica Nova, a group dedicated to academic and artistic research of Contemporary Experimental Music. Created in 2012 at the State University of ParanÃ¡, the group is composed of researchers, undergraduate, and graduate students. We hold our meetings biweekly in person and online, for the discussion of numerous agenda items: individual research of each member, funded research projects, events organization, dissemination of new works, organization, and release of digital albums, among other things.

Among our activities, we highlight the biennial event SiMN - International Symposium of New Music, as well as independent projects by Ensemble MÃ³bile, a group dedicated to the performance of new music.

Please feel free to contact us in case you are interested in our research and projects.
